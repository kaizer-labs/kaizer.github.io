decisions:

    detail: "The system was designed around getting the right information into the response path, because reliability mattered more than conversational polish."
  - title: "Keep the system operable by normal engineering teams"
    detail: "Observability, maintainability, and explicit data sources mattered as much as model output quality. The design avoided patterns that would be difficult for a platform team to own over time."
  - title: "Anchor value in concrete workflows"
    detail: "The project emphasized internal knowledge access that could shorten lookup time and improve decision quality, not generic AI novelty disconnected from the team’s actual work."

## What I built

I architected retrieval-backed workflows for internal knowledge access across engineering and operational contexts. The goal was to make fragmented information easier to retrieve, use, and reason over in practical day-to-day work without turning the system into an untrustworthy assistant demo.

This project represents the AI side of the portfolio at its best: not novelty demos, but systems that treat retrieval quality and workflow usefulness as the product.

## How I approached it

The approach centered on grounding AI in retrieval instead of generic generation:

- identify the knowledge sources that mattered operationally
- structure retrieval so responses were anchored in actual internal context
- design for maintainability, observability, and workflow fit rather than conversational flair

That framing keeps the work aligned with backend and platform engineering instead of drifting into AI novelty work.

## Tradeoffs and key decisions

The key tradeoff was between flashy AI behavior and trustworthy workflows. More complexity does not automatically produce more value, especially when the system becomes harder to reason about or trust.

So the design direction prioritized:

- retrieval-backed outputs over unsupported answers
- operational usefulness over demo quality
- system integration and maintainability over novelty

That made the work a better fit for internal enablement and practical adoption.

## Results and impact

While there are no public-safe numeric metrics attached to this project, it still demonstrates something relevant for staff hiring: practical AI judgment. The value here is not flashy output quality. It is choosing trustworthy retrieval patterns, integrating them into real workflows, and keeping the system understandable enough that a team can operate it over time.
